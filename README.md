# Metabolomics Analysis of Three Distinct Challenges: Fasting, Physical Activity and Oral Lipid Tolerance Test (OLTT)

With this code a subset of the HuMet dataset was analyzed, focusing on **plasma** samples across three platforms:

- Metabolon HD4 (nt-ms)
- Biocrates p150 (t-ms)
- In-house biochemistry (chem.)

Since the original dataset lacked challenge information, it was assigned based on the time column:

- **Fasting**: Time points 1–10
- **Physical Activity**: Time points 33–39
- **Oral Lipid Tolerance Test (OLTT)**: Time points 40–50
